       "Think of 50 Coin as 50/50 cryptocurrency and utility token, with the best of both worlds - a low maximum total circulation supply of 50,000,000 FFTY, and the utility and faster transaction speed of Ethereum with its smart contract capability and cross-chain atomic swappability of ERC20 tokens. But FFTY is more than that: 50 Coin is built future-proof, existing on its own high-throughput, multi-dimensionally scalable (concensus scalable, state machine scalable, and interchain scalable), sovereign blockchain, hub, and zone, with CarbonSmart Tendermint Proof-of-Stake (PoS), cross-chain crypto-asset transferability with Bitcoin, Ethereum, ERC20 tokens, future ERC223 tokens, and Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) interoperability with infinite existing and future blockchains. And quite notably, stakers of 50 Coin earn substantial PoS interest for 5 years."
