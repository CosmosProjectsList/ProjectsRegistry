       "Cosmic Bridge can be used for any application that requires cheap, fast and auditable settlement of Bitcoin transactions, assuming on-demand Bitcoin-chain settlement is acceptable. Payment Zones can be free for anyone to join, or limited to certain parties. In theory, the longer users maintain and use the balances on the cosmos bridge network, the more optimizations can be done in terms of payment merging. Some potential applications:",
       " - Bitcoin micropayments",
       " - Dark pools of BTC liquidity between exchanges or large traders",
       " - A merchant network supporting free bitcoin payments for participating merchants"
