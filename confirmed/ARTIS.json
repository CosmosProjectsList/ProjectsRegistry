       "The ARTIS Network is an easy-to-use public blockchain system that is built with sustainability in mind by doing away with energy-intensive mining. As an Ethereum sidechain, the ARTIS Network is using the performant Parity-node software which has WebAssembly enabled â€“ allowing every smart contract to be developed with outstanding security using Rust, C or C++. Existing DApps can migrate or use several blockchains in parallel, whatever is preferred and more suitable."
