    "description_long": [
       "This module is currently under active development but works as a fully-functional prototype on top of Bitcoin testnet",
       "This module implements a simplified version of the 'Proof-of-Stake Bitcoin Sidechains' design. It works by holding Bitcoin in a special script which is a multisig spendable by consensus of the validators of a Tendermint blockchain.",
       "This module can be dropped in to any Lotion app to enable the chain to hold reserves of Bitcoin, accept deposits, or pay out withdrawals in a low-trust manner. In addition, it lets the chain timestamp itself on the Bitcoin blockchain, increasing security of the chain by utilizing Bitcoin's proof-of-work."
