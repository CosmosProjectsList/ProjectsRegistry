       "Chainpoint links a hash of your data to a blockchain and returns a timestamp proof. A Chainpoint Node receives hashes which are aggregated together using a Merkle tree. The root of this tree is published in a Bitcoin transaction. The final Chainpoint proof defines a set of operations that cryptographically link your data to the Bitcoin blockchain."
